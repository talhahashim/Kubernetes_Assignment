## Observations After Deleting Pods

### Vote Pod Deletion
- **Frontend Observation:** The voting app stopped working.
- **Unix Logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=vote
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [1] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 21.2.0
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [1] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:80 (1)
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [1] [INFO] Using worker: sync
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [6] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 6
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [7] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 7
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [8] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 8
[2024-07-29 02:00:34 +0000] [9] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 9
```

### Worker Pod Deletion
- **Frontend Observation:** New votes are not being processed.
- **Unix Logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=worker
Connected to db
Found redis at 10.99.13.18

```

### DB Pod Deletion
- **Frontend Observation:** The result app stopped working.
- **Unix Logs:**
```bash
kubectl logs -l app=db
PostgreSQL init process complete; ready for start up.
LOG:  database system was shut down at 2024-07-29 02:01:07 UTC
LOG:  MultiXact member wraparound protections are now enabled
LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
LOG:  autovacuum launcher started
ERROR:  relation "votes" does not exist at character 38
STATEMENT:  SELECT vote, COUNT(id) AS count FROM votes GROUP BY vote
ERROR:  relation "votes" does not exist at character 38
STATEMENT:  SELECT vote, COUNT(id) AS count FROM votes GROUP BY vote
```

## Why the Result App Stopped Working After DB Pod Stop
The result app stopped working because it relies on the database to fetch the voting results. Without the db pod, it cannot retrieve or update the results.

## How to Make the Result Pod Work
Recreate the db pod by reapplying the Kubernetes configurations:
```bash
kubectl apply -f .
```
Ensure all pods are running:
```bash
kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS        AGE
